ECG & HRV Analysis Report
==============================
Report generated on: 2025-05-21 15:15:12
Sampling Rate used for processing: 250 Hz
Filter applied: Bandpass 0.5-40.0 Hz, Order 6

--- HRV Time-Domain Metrics ---
Mean RR Interval: 1356.27 ms
SDNN (Standard Deviation of NN intervals): 993.49 ms
RMSSD (Root Mean Square of Successive Differences): 1272.91 ms
pNN50 (Percentage of successive NN intervals > 50ms): 92.75 %
Mean Heart Rate: 44.24 BPM

Total number of RR intervals analyzed: 1325
Total number of R-peaks detected: 1326

--- Notes ---
SDNN reflects overall HRV. Higher values generally indicate better autonomic function.
RMSSD reflects short-term, high-frequency HRV, primarily influenced by parasympathetic activity.
pNN50 also reflects parasympathetic activity.
Interpret these values in context and ideally compare against personal baselines or population norms.
